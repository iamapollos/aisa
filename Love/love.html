<h1>Love</h1>

<p>Everyone defines love in his or her way, but generally, Love is a set of emotions and behaviors characterized by intimacy, passion, and commitment. It involves care, closeness, protectiveness, attraction, affection, and trust. Love can vary in intensity and can change over time.</p>

<h3>The 3 Ls</h3>
  <img src="love.jpg" width="20%" alt="The 3Ls pic"> 
<p>Look for the good and be the positive.
Learn from mistakes but let go of past what-ifs.
Laugh whenever you can, especially at yourself.
Learn to listen and listen to learn.
Lift up others.
Lead with grace.
Lose with faith.
Live with hope.
Love.</p>

	
<h3>Long Distance Love</h3>
<p>A situation where you cannot look one another in the eye, much less give hugs, kisses or go on a romantic date. Then, this is for you to send to your partner, and perhaps to yourself!</p>
